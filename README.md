# Bandgap Reference Design 
This project simulates the designed Bandgap Reference circuit to determine its performance characterisitics pre-layout and post-layout. 

*Note: Circuit requires further optimization to improve performance. Design yet to be modified.*


## A Glance at the Bandgap Reference IP

To learn more about Bandgap Reference, its principle of generation, Implementation, Issues & Improvements, consider reading [this](/Documentation/BGR.pdf).

To gain insight into the applications and significance of Bandgap Reference in VLSI, have a look at [this](/Documentation/Applications.pdf).

To review the previous Bandgap Reference Design, read [this](/Documentation/README_old_version.md).

The  Design Specifications of the Bandgap Reference Circuit can be found [here](/Documentation/Specifications.pdf).

**Disclaimer:** 




**1. Layout is incomplete owing to non-availability of Vertical PNP BJT model definition in the Open-Sourced 180nm Technology Files provided by OSU.** 

**2. Layout of the Vertical PNP BJT is still in the development phase and will be updated soon.**

## About Ngspice 
Ngspice is an open source mixed-signal circuit simulator.

### Installing Ngspice

#### For Ubuntu

Open your terminal and type the following to install Ngspice
```
$  sudo apt-get install -y ngspice
```

## Running the Simulation

To clone the Repository and download the Netlist files for Simulation, enter the following commands in your terminal.

```
$  sudo apt install -y git
$  git clone https://github.com/sherylcorina/BandgapReference
$  cd BandgapReference/Simulation/Ngspice_Simulation/Simulation_Week_4_5
```

*Note: Before running simulation, ensure that the osu018.lib file is in the same directory as the other .cir files. Else you will need to modify the .cir files and add the approporiate path of osu018.lib*

To enter the Ngspice Shell, open the terminal & type:
```
$ ngspice
```
To simulate a netlist, type:
```
ngspice 1 ->  source <filename>.cir
```

You can exit from the Ngspice Shell by typing:
```
ngspice 1 ->  exit
```
 <p align="center"> or </p>
 
```
ngspice 1 ->  quit
```

There are several waveforms that need to be obtained to observe the performance of the Bandgap reference circuit.
